Since I joined Facebook several friends asked me about the benefits. I think more people may be interested, so I decide to share 7 perks I benefited from. 401k matching and insurance are intentionally excluded since I consider them as compensation.

**WARNING** Benefits are subject to change. Do not quote this article if you are hired by Facebook.

## Overview
Here is an overview of the perks ranked by cash value:

## #1 Paid Parental Leave
Full-time employees at Facebook are eligible to take paid leave for up to 4 months. We can also take the leave intermittently within one year. With [a median pay of $240,000](https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/networth/article/Yes-median-pay-at-Facebook-really-is-about-12870786.php), this benefit is worth $80,000 for a typical Facebook employee.

Facebook is very family friendly. There are yearly events like "Take Your Kids to Work Day" and "Summer Party" which are fun for both parents and kids.

## #2 Relocation Bonus
If a new employee is relocated from a remote city, Facebook will offer a relocation package. This includes moving service and relocation bonus. The bonus may vary. From my own experience and [online data](https://www.teamblind.com/article/Facebook-New-Employee-Relocation-Bonus-O8czDUNu), $25,000 is a typical amount for a family.

When we relocated to Menlo Park, the moving company took care of all our belongs. Our car was shipped for free. Free corporate housing was also provided for a month before we find a place to live. The whole experience was anything but a hassle.

## #3 Food
At Facebook, breakfast, lunch, and dinner are all free. Employees can also get free snacks and drinks in micro kitchens just around the corners. There are team happy hours with free food and alcoholic beverages at least every month. Not to mention all the special occasions, for example, the WhatsApp 10 years party we just had.

Easy access to food saves us a lot of time. Assuming 200 work days each year and $30 spent on food if not provided by Facebook, the cash value of this perk is about $6000 per year.

## #4 Baby Cash
Having the first baby at Facebook? A new parent will get $4,000 baby cash.

## #5 Daycare
A Facebook employee could get up to $3,000 in reimbursement per year for daycare. Preschool tuitions and other activities like summer camps can also be reimbursed.

## #6 Shuttle
Facebook provides shuttle services around the whole bay area. There are multiple shuttles at different times for the same route.

It usually took me 5 mins to walk to the stop. On the bus, I could work, listen to podcasts or just enjoy the view.

Assuming 200 work days each year and $10 spent on commute if not provided by Facebook, the cash value of this perk is about $2000 per year.

## #7 Wellness Reimbursement
Each year, an employee can get reimbursed for at most $750 on physical and mental wellness spending. Memberships, classes, and tickets are all included.

I think this is the most effective perks in terms of employee health. I end up playing badminton more frequently than I usually do.

## More Perks
There are so much more perks I did not cover here, for example, work phones, free accessories, on-site gyms, team offsite events, various courses, facebook ads dogfooding credits. These perks save us time and make our life easier at Facebook.
