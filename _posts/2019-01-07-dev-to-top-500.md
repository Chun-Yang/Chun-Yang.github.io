Dev.to is a thriving community for programmers. Since 2016, a lot of great contents are created, shared and liked in this amazing community.

As a newcomer, I am curious what people on the community care about since I want my posts to be relevant.

So I decide to analyize the top 500 posts ever created on dev.to.

## data gathering
There is no API from dev.to. But they do already have the ranked posts on this page https://dev.to/top/infinity. All I needed to do was to scroll down until I get 500 posts and scrap the data. Here is the [script](https://gist.github.com/Chun-Yang/735cd1ef320b6baf313eebdfd210f463) and [data](https://gist.github.com/Chun-Yang/c19fd8c3209212fd820831a9e816a9d7)

There are so many things we can extra from the data. I decide to answer the follow questions:
- which author is most liked?
- which author gets the most comments?
- which tag is used most frequently?
- do popular posts have number in their title?
- vim vs emacs?

Here is the [script](https://gist.github.com/Chun-Yang/6acd00cf7f9a0f1dd29393175b2c25d8). And drumroll please!

## which tag is used most frequently?
Turns out that the most popular tags of top 500 posts are very similar to the tags on https://dev.to/tags.

It seems folks on dev.on are relatively new to programming #beginners. Also front end engineering is very popular here #javascript, #react. I think if I want to be popular, I can create some react related posts for beginners.

## do popular posts have number in their title?
About 100 posts out of 500 posts have number in the title. There does not seems to be any strong correlation between number in post title and popularity.

## vim vs emacs?
There are 6 #vim posts and 0 #emacs in top 500 posts. For all the vim users out there, I want to say __WE ARE THE CHAMPION__ on dev.to!

Just kidding. Dev.to is a very inclusive community. And it seems vim and emacs are not very popular topics in the community. It makes sense since dev.to is skewed to relatively young developers on their career life. Also morden editors are much more popular especially among new programmers.

## summary
That's it! Congratulations to you Ali Spittel and all contributors to this strong community! And may the best posts win!
