[dev.to](https://dev.to) is a thriving community for programmers. Since 2016, a lot of good contents are created, shared and liked.

As a newcomer, I am curious what people care about on dev.to since I want my posts to be relevant.

So I decided to analyze the top 500 posts ever created on dev.to.

## data gathering
There is no API provided by dev.to. But they do already have the ranked posts on this page https://dev.to/top/infinity. All I needed to do was to scroll down until I get 500 posts and scrap the data. Here is the [script](https://gist.github.com/Chun-Yang/735cd1ef320b6baf313eebdfd210f463) and [data](https://gist.github.com/Chun-Yang/c19fd8c3209212fd820831a9e816a9d7).

There are so many things we can extract from the data. I am interested in the following questions:
- which author is most liked?
- which author gets the most comments?
- which tag is used most frequently?
- do popular posts have any numbers in their title?
- vim vs emacs?

And I wrote a [script](https://gist.github.com/Chun-Yang/6acd00cf7f9a0f1dd29393175b2c25d8) to get answers. Are you also eager to know the answers? Drumroll, please!

[Ali Spittel](https://dev.to/aspittel) with 23 posts in top 500 is absolutely the darling of dev.to! I personally find her posts on the topic of blogging really informative and actionable.

## which tag is used most frequently?
Turns out that the most popular tags of the top 500 posts are very similar to the tags on https://dev.to/tags.

It seems folks on dev.on are relatively new to programming #beginners. Also, front end engineering is very popular here #javascript, #react.

Aha! I think I can create some react related posts for beginners to get more likes.üòú

## do popular posts have any numbers in their title?
About 100 posts out of 500 posts have numbers in the title. There does not seem to be any strong correlation between any numbers in post title and popularity.

## vim vs emacs?
There are 6 #vim and 0 #emacs posts in top 500. For all the vim users out there, I want to say __WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS__ on dev.to!

Just kidding. dev.to is a very inclusive community. It seems neither vim or emacs are very popular topics in the community. Also, modern editors like VC code are much more popular, especially among new programmers.

## conclusion

After analyzing the top 500 posts on dev.to, I found that web developers on their early career are the predominant members on dev.to.

That's it! And may the best posts win!
